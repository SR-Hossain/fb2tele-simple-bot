## Summary

🤖 This project allows you to scrape posts from a Facebook group/page and send them to a Telegram channel/group using a Telegram bot. It provides the simplest way to achieve this functionality.

🔧 To get started, make sure you have installed the necessary pre-requisites.

🌐 Once the pre-requisites are installed, you can use PythonAnywhere and UptimeRobot to automate the process. PythonAnywhere can be used to host your scripts for free and UptimeRobot can be configured to ping your site based on your preference rate e.g. every 15 minutes, triggering the execution of the scraping scripts.

🚀 If you wish to use an advanced web scraper like Selenium, which can fetch updated posts in real-time, you can check out the project [fb2tele-selenium](https://github.com/SR-Hossain/fb2tele-selenium). It provides additional functionality to scrape posts from Facebook and immediately send them to a Telegram channel/group using a Telegram bot in real-time the moment it was posted in facebook. Make sure to follow the instructions in the project's README to get started.
